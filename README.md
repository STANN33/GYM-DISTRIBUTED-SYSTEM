      GYM-DISTRIBUTED-SYSTEM
Project Overview
The Gym Management System is a modular, distributed application built in Java to streamline the operations of a fitness center. It provides a scalable solution for managing memberships, workout tracking, and scheduling, while ensuring reliability and extensibility for future growth.

     Key Features
- Membership Management
- User registration, authentication, and profile handling.
- Role-based access (admin, trainer, member).
- Workout Tracking
- Personalized workout plans and exercise logs.
- Progress monitoring with structured data storage.
- Scheduling
- Class booking and trainer availability management.
- Concurrency handling to prevent double-bookings.
- Database Integration
- Relational schema designed with normalization principles.
- CRUD operations implemented via JDBC for seamless data persistence.

      Technical Implementation
- Language & Paradigm: Java, leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles (inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces).
- Architecture: Distributed modular design separating membership, workout, and scheduling services.
- Database: SQL-based relational database integrated through JDBC.
- Scalability: System structured for future extensions (e.g., payments, analytics).
- Reliability: Fault-tolerant design ensuring one module’s failure does not affect the entire system.

       Outcomes
- Delivered a robust, maintainable backend system for gym operations.
- Demonstrated expertise in Java OOP, distributed systems, and database integration.
- Created a foundation for real-world scalability and extensibility in fitness management software.
